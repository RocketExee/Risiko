Start learning how to generate the main menu first.
Think about art last, just do something that works as intended, like a page with a "insert name", "choose color"
Try and see if you can make a button like "start" actually work and bring you to another page, or do something
Then go on with it and if you really feel it necessary, make the menu art and aspect better, as much as you can
