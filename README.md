The idea is to create a Risiko! game that can be played by me and some friends.
Doing this I'll try to learn new coding skills, mostly regarding CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

GAME IDEAS
Map should be a 3d-ish thing, where all the areas are similar to the original game. There should also be tanks in every territory or something to tell how many are there.
When a player attacks, or does something related to one or more territories, then the game should zoom in on that territory(ies), also "elevating" it(them). Then add some animations
for the battle, the organization of troops, as well as some sounds.
Game rules should be the classic ones, with maybe some fun or different variations, to be selected in the main menu.
Main menu should be simple, maybe in 2D or pixel art.
